# CyberSecurity_Journey
Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Learning Journey** — a long-term documentation of everything I study, practice, and build as I become a professional in **Cybersecurity → Blockchain Security

## About me
- 🎓 Bachelor’s in Computer Science — solid foundations in algorithms, systems, and software engineering  
- 🎓 Master’s (in progress) — Data Science (1st year) — bringing statistical and ML knowledge to cybersecurity problems  
- 🌍 Based in Tunisia

## Core security skills
- **Networking & Protocols:** TCP/IP, routing, common network analysis techniques  
- **Cryptography basics:** symmetric/asymmetric concepts, hashing, practical usage (crypto hygiene)  
- **Linux & Windows:** day-to-day commands, shell scripting, system administration fundamentals  

## Current learning & certifications
- 📘 **Cisco — Junior Cybersecurity Analyst** (120 h) — in progress  
- 🧪 Active hands-on practice on **TryHackMe** (rooms, walkthroughs, CTFs)  
- 📚 Continuing study of blue-team and red-team methodologies, plus tooling (Wireshark, Nmap, Burp, basic SIEM work)

## What you’ll find in this repo
- `01_Networking_and_Linux/` — notes, labs, packet captures, configurations  
- `02_Ethical_Hacking/` — pentest notes, methodology, TryHackMe write-ups  
- `03_Blue_Team/` — log analysis, detection rules, incident response playbooks  
- `04_Red_Team/` — exploitation notes, lab reports, safe PoCs (educational only)  
- `05_Blockchain_Security/` — smart contract audits, threat models (future)  
- `06_AI_Agents_in_Security/` — ideas and experiments marrying ML/agents with security automation

## Goals
- Build a professional portfolio of reproducible labs and reports  
- Earn industry-relevant certifications (Security+, CEH, OSCP, plus blockchain security learning)  
- Specialize in **blockchain security** and **AI-driven security automation** by the end of the master’s program

## Contributing & usage
This repo is primarily a personal learning log — but contributions and friendly feedback are welcome. If you use any lab notes, please:
- Respect ethical rules — do **not** run offensive tools against systems you do not own or are not authorized to test.  
- Open an issue or PR if you find errors or want to suggest improvements
